// a line with only one value marks a new creature
// the other lines are interpreted as follows, where the Inc is always as part of other values
// level1, IncWild, IncDom, TameBonusAdd, TameBonusMult
// the order is always: Health, Stamina, Oxygen, Food, Weight, MeleeDamage, Speed, Torpor
// if a creature has no oxygen, set basevalue to 0 and the stat will be deactivated
